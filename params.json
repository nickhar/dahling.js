It determines if the browser is currently in a particular media mode. Use the same media query as you would in CSS or in a `<link>` file.\r\n 2. It provides the ability to load internal or external JS files.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n* `dahling()`\r\n* `loadJS()`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"dahling.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\r\n   if (dahling(\"screen and (max-width:800px)\"){\r\n      //do something for the screen, dahling\r\n   }\r\n\t \r\n   if (dahling(\"all and (orientation:portrait)\")){\r\n      //react to portrait mode, dahling\r\n   } \r\n\r\n   if (dahling(\"screen and (max-width:481px)\"){\r\n      // Log notification to the console\r\n      console.log(\"Less than 481px\");\r\n      \r\n      // Alert the user\r\n      alert(\"Less than 481px\");\r\n      \r\n      // Load required JS file based on max-width\r\n      loadJS('mobile.js','body');\r\n    }\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2010-2013 Nick Harrison <<nickharrison@gmail.com>>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in \r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, \r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the \r\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, \r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
