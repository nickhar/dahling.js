It determines if the browser is currently in a particular media mode (on load). Use the same media query as you would in CSS or in a `<link>` file.\r\n 2. It provides the ability to load external plain or queried JS or CSS files - individually or as an array.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n* `dahling()`\r\n* `load()`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"dahling.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\r\n   if (dahling(\"screen and (max-width:800px)\")){\r\n      //do something for the screen\r\n   }\r\n\t \r\n   if (dahling(\"all and (orientation:portrait)\")){\r\n      //react to portrait mode\r\n   } \r\n\r\n\r\n// Load external files\r\n   if (dahling(\"screen and (max-width:481px)\")){\r\n      \r\n   // Load required JS file based on max-width\r\n      load('mobile.js');\r\n      \r\n   // Load several files\r\n      load(['mobile.js','mobile.css']);\r\n      \r\n   // Load queried files\r\n      load('mobile.js?123');\r\n      \r\n   // Log notification to the console\r\n      console.log(\"Mobile mode\");\r\n      \r\n   // Alert the user\r\n      alert(\"Mobile mode\");\r\n      \r\n   }\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n* Include addListeners - enabling loading/actions on media query state changes\r\n* Add generic classes for desktop, tablet, phone\r\n* Look at the ability to include queries for specific devices\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2010-2013 Nick Harrison <<https://github.com/nickhar>>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in \r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, \r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the \r\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, \r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n","google":"UA-288720-14","note":"Don't delete this file!
