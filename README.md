## Features
 
dahling.js provides two simple functions at present:

 1. It determines if the browser is currently in a particular media mode (on load). Use the same media query as you would in CSS or in a `<link>` file.
 2. It provides the ability to load external plain or queried JS or CSS files - individually or as an array.

## Methods

* `dahling()`
* `load()`


## Examples

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dahling.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

   if (dahling("screen and (max-width:800px)")){
      //do something for the screen
   }
	 
   if (dahling("all and (orientation:portrait)")){
      //react to portrait mode
   } 


// Load external files
   if (dahling("screen and (max-width:481px)")){
      
   // Load required JS file based on max-width
      load('mobile.js');
      
   // Load several files
      load(['mobile.js','mobile.css']);
      
   // Load queried files
      load('mobile.js?123');
      
   // Log notification to the console
      console.log("Mobile mode");
      
   // Alert the user
      alert("Mobile mode");
      
   }

</script>
```

## Roadmap

* Include addListeners - enabling loading/actions on media query state changes
* Add generic classes for desktop, tablet, phone
* Look at the ability to include queries for specific devices
