## Features
 
dahling.js provides two simple functions:

 1. It determines if the browser is currently in a particular media mode. Use the same media query as you would in CSS or in a `<link>` file.
 2. It provides the ability to load internal or external JS files.

## Methods

* `dahling()`
* `loadJS()`


## Examples

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dahling.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

   if (dahling("screen and (max-width:800px)")){
      //do something for the screen
   }
	 
   if (dahling("all and (orientation:portrait)")){
      //react to portrait mode
   } 

   if (dahling("screen and (max-width:481px)")){
      
   // Load required JS file based on max-width
      loadJS('mobile.js','body');
      
   // Log notification to the console
      console.log("Less than 481px");
      
   // Alert the user
      alert("Less than 481px");
      
    }

</script>
```
