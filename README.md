dahling.js
==========

A simple, ultra-small media query js loader

dahling, it's nothing but media...

This script does two things:
 
 1. Determines if the browser is currently in a particular media
   mode. Use the same media query as you would in CSS or on a <link>
   element.

 2. Allows you to attach a JS file based upon the media query.
